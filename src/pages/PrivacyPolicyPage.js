        <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
        <p>We may share your information in the following circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We share information with third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf, such as cloud hosting (Firebase Firestore), analytics (Firebase Analytics), authentication (Firebase Auth), and advertising (Ad Networks). These providers are authorized to use your information only as necessary to provide these services to us.</li>
            <li><strong>Advertising Partners:</strong> If we show ads, we share certain information (like advertising IDs and usage data) with our advertising partners to enable them to deliver targeted advertisements.</li>

        </ul>
        <p>We do not sell your personal information.</p>

        <br />
        <h2>4. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
        <p>Depending on your location and applicable law, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access and Correction:</strong> You may have the right to access and update certain personal information we hold about you (e.g., through in-game settings if available, or by contacting us).</li>
            <li><strong>Data Deletion:</strong> You may request the deletion of your personal information. We will comply with such requests where required by law. Note that deleting your data may result in the loss of your game progress and account. You can also clear local PlayerPrefs data by uninstalling the Game or clearing app data through your device settings.</li>
            <li><strong>Opt-Out of Targeted Advertising:</strong> You can usually opt out of interest-based advertising on mobile applications by checking the settings of your device (e.g., "Limit Ad Tracking" on iOS or "Opt out of Ads Personalization" on Android) and/ or through the settings of our advertising partners.</li>
            <li><strong>Managing Notifications:</strong> You can manage local reminder notifications through your device's system settings or in-game settings (if available).</li>
            <li><strong>Firebase Data:</strong> If you wish to request deletion of data stored on Firebase associated with your anonymous user ID, please contact us. We will make reasonable efforts to comply with your request, subject to technical feasibility and legal requirements.</li>
        </ul>

        <br />
        <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We retain your personal information for as long as necessary to provide you with the Services, fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Gameplay data stored locally via PlayerPrefs remains on your device until the app is uninstalled or app data is cleared. Data stored on Firebase will be retained as per our operational needs and legal requirements.</p>

        <br />
        <h2>6. Security</h2>
        <p>We take reasonable administrative, technical, and physical measures to protect your personal information from loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. However, no internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error-free, so you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us.</p>

        <br />
        <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our Services are designed to be appropriate for a general audience, including children. We are committed to protecting the privacy of children who use our Services. This section explains our practices with respect to information collected from children under the age of 13 (or the applicable age of digital consent in your jurisdiction, e.g., 16 in some EU countries), ("Child" or "Children").</p>
        
        <br />
        <h3>A. Age Gate and Data Collection:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>During our onboarding process, we ask users for their age.</li>
            <li>For users identified as Children: We limit the collection of personal information. The personal information we may collect from Children is strictly for the support of internal operations of the Game, such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>A persistent identifier (like a device ID or an internal user ID generated by Firebase Anonymous Auth) to save game progress, manage local high scores, and for analytics to improve game performance.</li>
                    <li>Country or region (derived from IP address, but the IP address itself is not persistently stored in a way that identifies the child).</li>
                    <li>Gameplay information (virtual portfolio value, game progress, scores) associated with the persistent identifier.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>We DO NOT collect more personal information from Children than is reasonably necessary to participate in the Game.</li>
            <li>We DO NOT use this information for behavioral advertising or to create profiles of Children for any other purpose than supporting the internal operations of our Game.</li>
        </ul>

        <br />
        <h3>B. Parental Consent:</h3>
        <p>For features that might involve collecting, using, or disclosing personal information beyond what is permissible for supporting internal operations (e.g., if we were to add features like chat or personalized accounts that store more identifiable information), we would implement a method to obtain verifiable parental consent before collecting such information from Children. Currently, TradeRun does not include such features that would require this level of consent for Children, as we limit data collection as described above.</p>
        <br />
        <h3>C. Third-Party Services and Children:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Firebase (Analytics, Firestore, Auth):</strong> We use Firebase services. For users identified as Children, data sent to Firebase is configured to support internal operations only. We rely on Google's commitments regarding their services' compliance with COPPA and GDPR-K.</li>
            <li><strong>Advertising:</strong> If advertisements are shown to Children, they will be contextually targeted (based on the game content) rather than behaviorally targeted (based on user activity across apps/sites). We will use ad networks that offer options for serving non-personalized ads or ads appropriate for child-directed services. Google AdMob is configured to serve non-personalized ads to users identified as children.</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <h3>D. Parental Rights:</h3>
        <p>Parents and legal guardians of Children have the right to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Review the personal information we have collected from their Child.</li>
            <li>Request that we delete the personal information collected from their Child.</li>
            <li>Refuse further collection or use of their Child's personal information.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To exercise these rights, please contact us at kanchan.nannavare@gmail.com. We will require you to verify your identity before processing such requests.</p>
        <br />
        <h2>8. International Data Transfers</h2>
        <p>Your information may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ from those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, please note that we transfer data, including personal information, to the United States (where Firebase servers are primarily located) and process it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.</p>
        <br />
        <h2>9. Third-Party Links and Services</h2>
        <p>Our Services may contain links to third-party websites or services, or integrate third-party services (like Firebase and Ad Networks). We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties. We encourage you to read their privacy policies before providing any information to them.</p>
        <br />
        <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify you by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy and, if required by law, by providing a more prominent notice (such as by adding a statement to our Game's start screen or sending you a notification). We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
        </p>
